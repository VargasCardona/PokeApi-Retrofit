## Background
Retrofit is a powerful type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, widely used for interacting with REST APIs. This project utilizes Retrofit to connect to the PokeAPI, retrieving data about Pokémon to demonstrate API integration within an Android app.

## Features
- API Integration: Connects to the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data.
- Data Display: Displays basic Pokémon information, such as names, types, and stats.
- Modular Structure: Organized codebase with separation of concerns for networking, model classes, and view components.

## Technical Details
- Programming Language: Kotlin
- Networking: Uses Retrofit to manage API requests and Gson for JSON parsing.
- API: Connects to PokeAPI for Pokémon data.
- UI Components: Displays data within a RecyclerView with simple item views for Pokémon details.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the Repository:
```
